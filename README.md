This section contains a collection of python scripts I wrote.


Bezier curve interpolation
--------------------------

A short script which takes n number of control points and calculates the bezier
curve. The figure below shows a resulting bezier curve for 8 control points. This
image is produced by calling [bcurve.py](./python/bcurve.py) as main script.
Read the code to understand how the function has to be called. The script is
quite short and easy to understand. The theory for the calculation, especially
the n degree bezier calculation, can be found at [wiki Bezier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)
and in the Openg SuperBidle which highly recommend to read.
